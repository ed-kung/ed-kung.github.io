My name is Edward Kung.

I am an economics professor in the [David Nazarian College of Business and Economics at CSUN](https://nazarian.csun.edu/){:target="_blank"} and a Research Fellow at the [UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate](https://www.anderson.ucla.edu/about/centers/ucla-ziman-center-for-real-estate){:target="_blank"}.

I also have experience working part-time as a data scientist and machine learning engineer.

I am a husband and the father of two children.

I live in Los Angeles and attend church at [Immanuel Bible Church](https://ibcbible.org){:target="_blank"}.

My [academic work](/research) focuses on housing, urban, and real estate economics. More generally, I am interested in using data to creatively solve problems and to answer challenging questions.  I am available for consulting.  Feel free to reach out to me about my work!
