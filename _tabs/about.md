My name is Edward Kung.

I am an economics professor in the David Nazarian College of Business and Economics at [CSUN](https://www.csun.edu){:target="_blank"}.

I also work part-time as a data scientist and machine learning engineer at [Gusto](https://www.gusto.com){:target="_blank"}.

I am a husband and the father of two children.

I live in Los Angeles and attend church at [Immanuel Bible Church](https://ibcbible.org){:target="_blank"}.

My [academic work](/research) focuses on housing, urban, and real estate economics. More generally, I am interested in using data to creatively solve problems and to answer challenging questions.  I am available for consulting.  Feel free to reach out to me about my work!
