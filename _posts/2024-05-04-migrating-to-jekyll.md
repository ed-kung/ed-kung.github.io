Over the past few days I've been migrating my personal website from BlueHost/WordPress to Github Pages/Jekyll.

Migrating made a lot of sense for a few reasons:

- I've started hosting most of my course content on Github Pages. By migrating my personal website to Github Pages I'll have all my content under a consistent domain name: [ed-kung.github.io](https://ed-kung.github.io).

- I enjoy writing in Markdown and Jekyll is designed to work seamlessly with Markdown.  

- I found WordPress too complicated. It is undoubtedly powerful, but I wasn't using most of its features. I also didn't like how it hid code from me.

- I want to take advantage of git's version control system.

Over the coming days I'll be porting some of the older content from my previous website over to the new one. I'll also redirect my old web address [ekung.io](https://ekung.io) to here.
