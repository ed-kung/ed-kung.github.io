Here are some math equations:

$$ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N x_i $$

$$ y_i = \mathbf{X} \beta + \epsilon_i $$

Here's a python code snippet:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("mydata.csv")
```

Here's a R code snippet:

```r
rm(list=ls())
library(dplyr)

df <- read.csv("mydata.csv")
```
